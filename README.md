# Ansible Collection - vladgh.system

![Test](https://github.com/vladgh/ansible-collection-vladgh-system/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

Ansible collection that holds roles, that can be used to configure common system services.

## Using this collection

### Installing the Collection from Ansible Galaxy

Install it with the Ansible Galaxy CLI:

```sh
ansible-galaxy collection install vladgh.system  --upgrade
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: vladgh.system
```

Using the GitHub repository and branch

```yaml
collections:
  - name: https://github.com/vladgh/ansible-collection-vladgh-system
    version: main
    type: git
```

Install the requirements for playbooks

```sh
ansible-galaxy install --verbose --force --role-file ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/vladgh/system/requirements.yml
```

### Roles

```yaml
---
- name: Common
  hosts: all
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: vladgh.system.common
```

### Playbooks

Before using the playbooks, install the required external roles and collections (modify to your own collections installation path)

```sh
ansible-galaxy install --verbose --force --role-file ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/vladgh/system/collection-requirements.yml`
```

Import playbooks
